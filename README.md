# hrglass-gotime-script

got the idea last night to build a faster way to context switch between clients, and it came as this for my first version. One client of mine at the moment is hr.glass and i use a certain set of chrome pages, dev apps, and communication apps. this is a way to only run one command to open everything for that client. And easy to edit. All i have to do is enter the command 'bash hrglass.sh' and i dont have to think about what i need as much
eventually i want to find a way to make it double clickable to run the script. That will come later
